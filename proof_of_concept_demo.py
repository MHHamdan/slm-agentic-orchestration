Proof-of-Concept Demonstration: Customer Service Ticket Classification
Priority P0 - Phase 1, Week 2 implementation

This demonstrates the core thesis: SLMs can handle simple tasks at 10× lower cost
with comparable accuracy to LLMs.

Target metrics:
- 90% accuracy on customer service classification  
- 10× cost reduction vs GPT-4
- <100ms latency for SLM processing
